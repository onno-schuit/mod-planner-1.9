TODO's

0. [ ] Lock down teachers: should not be able to call student specific urls.
1. [ ] Include proper support for groups
2. [X] Add backup methods
3. [ ] Scale down legend (no more than 3 colors): leave out 'graded' criterion (this is visible in another column anyway)
4. [ ] Include proper navigation buttons (esp. back button)
5. [ ] Attach capabilities to teachers and students. Do not make a distinction between those types of users in the code 
       itself (cf. assignment/db/acces.php).
